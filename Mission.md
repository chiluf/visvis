## Mission ##

The mission of visvis is to create a lightweight but powerful visualization toolkit that is easy to install, easy to use, enables making interactive tools, and can be used in (commercial) applications.

  * **Powerful:** thin layer, allowing the user to use OpenGl if necessary, use of GLSL
  * **Easy installation:** few dependencies, pure Python
  * **Easy to use:** object oriented, much use of properties, good documentation, large set of convenience functions
  * **Interactive:** effective event system, support for picking
  * **Usable in apps:** multiple backends, easy embedding, liberal license.

Further, visvis is designed to be run from Python scripts, as well as in interactive sessions using IEP or IPython.
