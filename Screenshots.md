Martin Laloux is testing the use of visvis in Quantum GIS (http://www.qgis.org/), an open source Geographical Information System which is scriptable in Python. He extracts the  x, y, z coordinates of a point layer and uses vivis to visualize them in 3D:

Asmi Shah uses Visvis to visualize 3D color microscopic images. What you see here is a "zebrafish embryo's brain region, zoomed in at its right eye, at 48hpf". The RGB dataset has 512x512x213 voxels.

Here's a screenshot created by one of the scripts in the examples directory.
It illustrates several polygonal shapes that can be created and applies
a colormap and texture to a few of them:

Here's an image of a [stent graft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent) visualized using
the raycast render program. Contrast fluid was injected in the bloodstream during
acquisition of the CT scan, which enables distinguishing it from the surrounding tissue:

Lines can be visualized inside volumes (by setting their alpha value <1.). This way one can visualize all sorts of algorithm results:
